### Help
You can input anything.
Of course, this program can only handle **CSV** files and **Excel** files.
If the input is illegal, it will warn you.
If the input file does not exist, it will warn you, too.
To avoid too much output, output a maximum of $2000$ characters at a time.
You can terminate the program by typing `exit`.
### Environment
Python 3.7.6 64-bit
